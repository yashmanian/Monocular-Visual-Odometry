\subsection*{Overview}

This is a personal project with the objective of developing a custom implementation of Monocular Visual Odometry. I hope to contribute to this library fairly regularly. I will also be generating Doxygen documentation eventually.

\subsection*{Note }

This library is just a straightforward implementation at the moment. I plan to optimize it further and even use it for basic S\+L\+AM, down the line.

\subsection*{Inputs }

I will be using the K\+I\+T\+TI Odometry dataset. The ground truth poses will be used to compute absolute scale (seeing as I don\textquotesingle{}t have access to actual speedometer readings \+:P). I will be considering the folder structure to be similar to the K\+I\+T\+T\+I\+\_\+\+VO dataset. So if you want to use the code for yourself, you just need to change the base path as long as the internal folder structure is the same.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 Path to folder
2 +-- KITTI\_VO/
3 |   +-- poses/
4 |       +-- ground truth .txt files starting with 00.txt
5 |   +-- sequences/
6 |       +-- Sequence ID based folders (00/)
7 |           +-- image\_2/
8 |               +-- video frames in .png format, starting with 000000.png
9 |           +-- image\_3/
10 |               +-- video frames in .png format, starting with 000000.png
11 |           +-- calib.txt
12 |           +-- times.txt
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Todo (09/2/2018) }


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Test accuracy of Pose decomposition \& optimize function
\item Move Window generation to class and add destructor to close windows after end of execution.
\item Add P\+CL support for R\+A\+N\+S\+AC.
\item Convert to Eigen (Painful but necessary)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Example code on how to use the library will be updated in the cpp file src/main.\+cc.

\subsection*{How to build and run the demo}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To build and run demo\+: Update path to dataset in main.\+cc. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 mkdir build
2 cd build
3 cmake ..
4 make
5 ./vo
\end{DoxyCode}
 To use these functions in your own code. Add the include directory path to the compiler debugging. Include to the start of your code and call the functions\+:
\item To use the feature tracking and refinement library\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 #include "FeatTrack.hpp" 
\end{DoxyCode}

\item To use the egomotion estimation library\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 #include "epipolar.hpp" 
\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}
